POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of the FDT Manual as a digital *.document by download to the customer.&#xA;&#xA;§3 Terms of Use&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer may only copy the supplied software inasmuch as the copy is essential for using the program. Essential copies are such from original data carrier to customer&apos;s hard drive, and into the RAM memory of customer&apos;s hardware.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER permits the customer to make one backup copy of FDT. Customer is not allowed to sell the backup copy, or to pass on the backup copy to a third party.&#xA;3. Customer is not allowed to use the Software on a network that allows more than one person to work with this software at the same time, unless customer provides each person with a licensed copy.&#xA;4. This EULA allows the customer to install the software only once on a single computer. If the customer wants to use the licensed copy of FDT on different hardware, he must remove the software from the former hardware before starting the installation process.&#xA;5. Exception: Customer may employ an additional copy of the software on a second, portable device for the exclusive use of the primary user of the copy of the software.&#xA;6. Customer is not allowed to use this FDT License on several hardware systems at the same time.&#xA;7. Customer is not allowed to make copies of the FDT Manual. If the FDT Manual is a digital *.document, the customer may make one backup copy.&#xA;8. The software may only be transferred to a third party if this party agrees with the conditions of this EULA. All FDT copies must be handed over to the third party, including any backup copies, and the FDT Manuals. The right of the customer to use the FDT Software expires with handing over the FDT software to the third party or person. Customer must remove all copies of the FDT software from any hard drives.&#xA;9. In case the software is transferred to a third person or party, customer must inform POWERFLASHER of the name and legal address of the third party, in writing (§126b German Civil Code BGB).&#xA;10. The right to pass on the software to third parties is void  if reasonable suspicion exists the third party will violate these contract terms and conditions, or the copyrights of the supplier.&#xA;11. Customer  agrees that POWERFLASHER may, within a reasonable notification period, seek to verify that software use is in compliance with these terms and conditions. Should this verification show that use of the software is not in compliance with this contract, customer is obliged to reimburse verification expenses, in addition to any claims by POWERFLASHER that may arise from violation of terms and conditions.&#xA;&#xA;§ 4 Customer Responsibilities&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer is obliged to take sufficient measures to prevent unauthorized third parties from gaining illicit access to this software. Original data carriers and backup copies must be stored secure from illicit access by third parties. Customer&apos;s employees must be made aware of the terms and conditions of this contract, and POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyrights.&#xA;2. Customer may not attempt to alter the software in any way. Customer may not attempt to change, combine, adjust, translate, or disassemble it, or make visual representations thereof.&#xA;3. Customer is not permitted to rent, loan or sublicense software without express written consent by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;4. Furthermore, customer is not permitted to retranslate licensed program code into other forms  of code (decompiling).&#xA;5. Customer is not permitted to remove attributes that serve to safeguard POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyright, or that serve to prevent illicit copying.&#xA;&#xA;§ 5 Examination and Complaints&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer must examine provided software and manual within two weeks of receipt, in particularly as regards intactness of software and manual, as well as the working of basic software functions. Complaints that are evident or result from this examination must be reported to manufacturer within one additional week in writing (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b). A detailed description of the defect is required.&#xA;2. Defects to software or manual not evident in the course of this examination as required in Paragraph 1 above, must be communicated within one week of discovery, in writing  (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b).&#xA;3. Should these responsibilities to examine and report defects be violated, any defect is held to be approved by customer.&#xA;&#xA;§ 6 Limited Warranty and Liability&#xA;&#xA;1. Manufacturer&apos;s liability for product defects is regulated by German commercial law alone (German Civil Code BGB, § 434 and following).&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER&apos;s liability (pre-contractual, contractual and extra-contractual) is limited to deliberate and gross negligence. This liability limitation applies to liabilities of third-party vendors employed by manufacturer as well.&#xA;&#xA;§ 7 Terms of Payment and Reservation of Proprietary Rights&#xA;&#xA;1. After delivery of the software in question, payment is due to POWERFLASHER as invoiced to the customer. Invoice includes German sales tax and is payable within 10 working days.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER retains property of software delivered to customer until receipt of full payment as contractually agreed (German Civil Code BGB, § 7 1st Sentence).&#xA;3. Should customer violate terms of payment, invocation of property rights does not imply cancellation of contract unless expressly stated by POWERFLASHER to customer.&#xA;4. Should POWERFLASHER invoke retention of property rights, the right to continued use of software in question by customer is waived. All copies of software made by customer must be removed.&#xA;&#xA;§ 8 Upgrade&#xA;1. Insofar as the software is an upgrade of an earlier version of the software, customer must possess a valid license for the existing earlier full version in order to install or use said upgrade.&#xA;2. Insofar as customer received a rebate for the upgrade based on an existing earlier license, software is to be provided as a license exchange. By installing and using the upgrade, customer agrees to end the existing prior EULA and refrain from reinstalling the previous licensed version of the software, or transferring it to other natural or corporate persons.&#xA;3. Customer may continue using the earlier software version, for which the upgrade in question was obtained, if the upgrade and the copy of the earlier version are both installed on the same computer, and if the earlier version is not installed on another computer.&#xA;4. Customer acknowledges that POWERFLASHER&apos;s obligation to support earlier software versions ends with the availability of an upgrade.&#xA;&#xA;§ 9 Additional Agreement for Non-EU Citizens&#xA;1.

          ATTENTION:&#xA;YOU WILL NEED TO SCROLL DOWN TO THE END OF THIS EULA BEFORE YOU CAN AGREE TO THE EULA AND CONTINUE WITH THE SOFTWARE INSTALLATION. READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION AND USING THE SOFTWARE.&#xA;IMPORTANT:&#xA;1. This contract (EULA = End User&apos;s License Agreement), is a legally binding agreement between the Person, Company or Organization that has licensed this Software (Customer), and Interactive Pioneers GmbH, unit Powerflasher (POWERFLASHER).&#xA;2. By installing and using the software, the customer accepts and agrees to the terms of this contract. Use of the software is legally equivalent to agreeing to the terms and conditions of this license.&#xA;&#xA;3. If you do not agree to this EULA, or if you do not have the authority to agree to this EULA on the customer&apos;s behalf, do not install or use the software, and return the software within 14 days for a full refund to your vendor, in accordance with vendor&apos;s general refund policies (Terms and Conditions).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. This EULA only applies to the software supplied by POWERFLASHER through this download or delivery, regardless of any other software described in this document.&#xA;&#xA;§1 Applicability of Contract&#xA;&#xA;1. This contract applies to the licensing of one copy of the FDT software, including the FDT Manual, by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;2. This contract does not apply to installation and post-installation service. This includes hardware and software service of any kind.&#xA;&#xA;§2 Duties of POWERFLASHER&#xA;&#xA;1. POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of FDT by download, according to §1 of this contract.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of the FDT Manual as a digital *.document by download to the customer.&#xA;&#xA;§3 Terms of Use&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer may only copy the supplied software inasmuch as the copy is essential for using the program. Essential copies are such from original data carrier to customer&apos;s hard drive, and into the RAM memory of customer&apos;s hardware.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER permits the customer to make one backup copy of FDT. Customer is not allowed to sell the backup copy, or to pass on the backup copy to a third party.&#xA;3. Customer is not allowed to use the Software on a network that allows more than one person to work with this software at the same time, unless customer provides each person with a licensed copy.&#xA;4. This EULA allows the customer to install the software only once on a single computer. If the customer wants to use the licensed copy of FDT on different hardware, he must remove the software from the former hardware before starting the installation process.&#xA;5. Exception: Customer may employ an additional copy of the software on a second, portable device for the exclusive use of the primary user of the copy of the software.&#xA;6. Customer is not allowed to use this FDT License on several hardware systems at the same time.&#xA;7. Customer is not allowed to make copies of the FDT Manual. If the FDT Manual is a digital *.document, the customer may make one backup copy.&#xA;8. The software may only be transferred to a third party if this party agrees with the conditions of this EULA. All FDT copies must be handed over to the third party, including any backup copies, and the FDT Manuals. The right of the customer to use the FDT Software expires with handing over the FDT software to the third party or person. Customer must remove all copies of the FDT software from any hard drives.&#xA;9. In case the software is transferred to a third person or party, customer must inform POWERFLASHER of the name and legal address of the third party, in writing (§126b German Civil Code BGB).&#xA;10. The right to pass on the software to third parties is void  if reasonable suspicion exists the third party will violate these contract terms and conditions, or the copyrights of the supplier.&#xA;11. Customer  agrees that POWERFLASHER may, within a reasonable notification period, seek to verify that software use is in compliance with these terms and conditions. Should this verification show that use of the software is not in compliance with this contract, customer is obliged to reimburse verification expenses, in addition to any claims by POWERFLASHER that may arise from violation of terms and conditions.&#xA;&#xA;§ 4 Customer Responsibilities&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer is obliged to take sufficient measures to prevent unauthorized third parties from gaining illicit access to this software. Original data carriers and backup copies must be stored secure from illicit access by third parties. Customer&apos;s employees must be made aware of the terms and conditions of this contract, and POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyrights.&#xA;2. Customer may not attempt to alter the software in any way. Customer may not attempt to change, combine, adjust, translate, or disassemble it, or make visual representations thereof.&#xA;3. Customer is not permitted to rent, loan or sublicense software without express written consent by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;4. Furthermore, customer is not permitted to retranslate licensed program code into other forms  of code (decompiling).&#xA;5. Customer is not permitted to remove attributes that serve to safeguard POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyright, or that serve to prevent illicit copying.&#xA;&#xA;§ 5 Examination and Complaints&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer must examine provided software and manual within two weeks of receipt, in particularly as regards intactness of software and manual, as well as the working of basic software functions. Complaints that are evident or result from this examination must be reported to manufacturer within one additional week in writing (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b). A detailed description of the defect is required.&#xA;2. Defects to software or manual not evident in the course of this examination as required in Paragraph 1 above, must be communicated within one week of discovery, in writing  (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b).&#xA;3. Should these responsibilities to examine and report defects be violated, any defect is held to be approved by customer.&#xA;&#xA;§ 6 Limited Warranty and Liability&#xA;&#xA;1. Manufacturer&apos;s liability for product defects is regulated by German commercial law alone (German Civil Code BGB, § 434 and following).&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER&apos;s liability (pre-contractual, contractual and extra-contractual) is limited to deliberate and gross negligence. This liability limitation applies to liabilities of third-party vendors employed by manufacturer as well.&#xA;&#xA;§ 7 Terms of Payment and Reservation of Proprietary Rights&#xA;&#xA;1. After delivery of the software in question, payment is due to POWERFLASHER as invoiced to the customer. Invoice includes German sales tax and is payable within 10 working days.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER retains property of software delivered to customer until receipt of full payment as contractually agreed (German Civil Code BGB, § 7 1st Sentence).&#xA;3. Should customer violate terms of payment, invocation of property rights does not imply cancellation of contract unless expressly stated by POWERFLASHER to customer.&#xA;4. Should POWERFLASHER invoke retention of property rights, the right to continued use of software in question by customer is waived. All copies of software made by customer must be removed.&#xA;&#xA;§ 8 Upgrade&#xA;1. Insofar as the software is an upgrade of an earlier version of the software, customer must possess a valid license for the existing earlier full version in order to install or use said upgrade.&#xA;2. Insofar as customer received a rebate for the upgrade based on an existing earlier license, software is to be provided as a license exchange. By installing and using the upgrade, customer agrees to end the existing prior EULA and refrain from reinstalling the previous licensed version of the software, or transferring it to other natural or corporate persons.&#xA;3. Customer may continue using the earlier software version, for which the upgrade in question was obtained, if the upgrade and the copy of the earlier version are both installed on the same computer, and if the earlier version is not installed on another computer.&#xA;4. Customer acknowledges that POWERFLASHER&apos;s obligation to support earlier software versions ends with the availability of an upgrade.&#xA;&#xA;§ 9 Additional Agreement for Non-EU Citizens&#xA;1.

          ATTENTION:&#xA;YOU WILL NEED TO SCROLL DOWN TO THE END OF THIS EULA BEFORE YOU CAN AGREE TO THE EULA AND CONTINUE WITH THE SOFTWARE INSTALLATION. READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION AND USING THE SOFTWARE.&#xA;IMPORTANT:&#xA;1. This contract (EULA = End User&apos;s License Agreement), is a legally binding agreement between the Person, Company or Organization that has licensed this Software (Customer), and Interactive Pioneers GmbH, unit Powerflasher (POWERFLASHER).&#xA;2. By installing and using the software, the customer accepts and agrees to the terms of this contract. Use of the software is legally equivalent to agreeing to the terms and conditions of this license.&#xA;&#xA;3. If you do not agree to this EULA, or if you do not have the authority to agree to this EULA on the customer&apos;s behalf, do not install or use the software, and return the software within 14 days for a full refund to your vendor, in accordance with vendor&apos;s general refund policies (Terms and Conditions).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. This EULA only applies to the software supplied by POWERFLASHER through this download or delivery, regardless of any other software described in this document.&#xA;&#xA;§1 Applicability of Contract&#xA;&#xA;1. This contract applies to the licensing of one copy of the FDT software, including the FDT Manual, by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;2. This contract does not apply to installation and post-installation service. This includes hardware and software service of any kind.&#xA;&#xA;§2 Duties of POWERFLASHER&#xA;&#xA;1. POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of FDT by download, according to §1 of this contract.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of the FDT Manual as a digital *.document by download to the customer.&#xA;&#xA;§3 Terms of Use&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer may only copy the supplied software inasmuch as the copy is essential for using the program. Essential copies are such from original data carrier to customer&apos;s hard drive, and into the RAM memory of customer&apos;s hardware.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER permits the customer to make one backup copy of FDT. Customer is not allowed to sell the backup copy, or to pass on the backup copy to a third party.&#xA;3. Customer is not allowed to use the Software on a network that allows more than one person to work with this software at the same time, unless customer provides each person with a licensed copy.&#xA;4. This EULA allows the customer to install the software only once on a single computer. If the customer wants to use the licensed copy of FDT on different hardware, he must remove the software from the former hardware before starting the installation process.&#xA;5. Exception: Customer may employ an additional copy of the software on a second, portable device for the exclusive use of the primary user of the copy of the software.&#xA;6. Customer is not allowed to use this FDT License on several hardware systems at the same time.&#xA;7. Customer is not allowed to make copies of the FDT Manual. If the FDT Manual is a digital *.document, the customer may make one backup copy.&#xA;8. The software may only be transferred to a third party if this party agrees with the conditions of this EULA. All FDT copies must be handed over to the third party, including any backup copies, and the FDT Manuals. The right of the customer to use the FDT Software expires with handing over the FDT software to the third party or person. Customer must remove all copies of the FDT software from any hard drives.&#xA;9. In case the software is transferred to a third person or party, customer must inform POWERFLASHER of the name and legal address of the third party, in writing (§126b German Civil Code BGB).&#xA;10. The right to pass on the software to third parties is void  if reasonable suspicion exists the third party will violate these contract terms and conditions, or the copyrights of the supplier.&#xA;11. Customer  agrees that POWERFLASHER may, within a reasonable notification period, seek to verify that software use is in compliance with these terms and conditions. Should this verification show that use of the software is not in compliance with this contract, customer is obliged to reimburse verification expenses, in addition to any claims by POWERFLASHER that may arise from violation of terms and conditions.&#xA;&#xA;§ 4 Customer Responsibilities&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer is obliged to take sufficient measures to prevent unauthorized third parties from gaining illicit access to this software. Original data carriers and backup copies must be stored secure from illicit access by third parties. Customer&apos;s employees must be made aware of the terms and conditions of this contract, and POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyrights.&#xA;2. Customer may not attempt to alter the software in any way. Customer may not attempt to change, combine, adjust, translate, or disassemble it, or make visual representations thereof.&#xA;3. Customer is not permitted to rent, loan or sublicense software without express written consent by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;4. Furthermore, customer is not permitted to retranslate licensed program code into other forms  of code (decompiling).&#xA;5. Customer is not permitted to remove attributes that serve to safeguard POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyright, or that serve to prevent illicit copying.&#xA;&#xA;§ 5 Examination and Complaints&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer must examine provided software and manual within two weeks of receipt, in particularly as regards intactness of software and manual, as well as the working of basic software functions. Complaints that are evident or result from this examination must be reported to manufacturer within one additional week in writing (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b). A detailed description of the defect is required.&#xA;2. Defects to software or manual not evident in the course of this examination as required in Paragraph 1 above, must be communicated within one week of discovery, in writing  (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b).&#xA;3. Should these responsibilities to examine and report defects be violated, any defect is held to be approved by customer.&#xA;&#xA;§ 6 Limited Warranty and Liability&#xA;&#xA;1. Manufacturer&apos;s liability for product defects is regulated by German commercial law alone (German Civil Code BGB, § 434 and following).&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER&apos;s liability (pre-contractual, contractual and extra-contractual) is limited to deliberate and gross negligence. This liability limitation applies to liabilities of third-party vendors employed by manufacturer as well.&#xA;&#xA;§ 7 Terms of Payment and Reservation of Proprietary Rights&#xA;&#xA;1. After delivery of the software in question, payment is due to POWERFLASHER as invoiced to the customer. Invoice includes German sales tax and is payable within 10 working days.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER retains property of software delivered to customer until receipt of full payment as contractually agreed (German Civil Code BGB, § 7 1st Sentence).&#xA;3. Should customer violate terms of payment, invocation of property rights does not imply cancellation of contract unless expressly stated by POWERFLASHER to customer.&#xA;4. Should POWERFLASHER invoke retention of property rights, the right to continued use of software in question by customer is waived. All copies of software made by customer must be removed.&#xA;&#xA;§ 8 Upgrade&#xA;1. Insofar as the software is an upgrade of an earlier version of the software, customer must possess a valid license for the existing earlier full version in order to install or use said upgrade.&#xA;2. Insofar as customer received a rebate for the upgrade based on an existing earlier license, software is to be provided as a license exchange. By installing and using the upgrade, customer agrees to end the existing prior EULA and refrain from reinstalling the previous licensed version of the software, or transferring it to other natural or corporate persons.&#xA;3. Customer may continue using the earlier software version, for which the upgrade in question was obtained, if the upgrade and the copy of the earlier version are both installed on the same computer, and if the earlier version is not installed on another computer.&#xA;4. Customer acknowledges that POWERFLASHER&apos;s obligation to support earlier software versions ends with the availability of an upgrade.&#xA;&#xA;§ 9 Additional Agreement for Non-EU Citizens&#xA;1.

READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION AND USING THE SOFTWARE.&#xA;IMPORTANT:&#xA;1. This contract (EULA = End User&apos;s License Agreement), is a legally binding agreement between the Person, Company or Organization that has licensed this Software (Customer), and Interactive Pioneers GmbH, unit Powerflasher (POWERFLASHER).&#xA;2. By installing and using the software, the customer accepts and agrees to the terms of this contract. Use of the software is legally equivalent to agreeing to the terms and conditions of this license.&#xA;&#xA;3.

This contract applies to the licensing of one copy of the FDT software, including the FDT Manual, by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;2. This contract does not apply to installation and post-installation service. This includes hardware and software service of any kind.&#xA;&#xA;§2 Duties of POWERFLASHER&#xA;&#xA;1. POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of FDT by download, according to §1 of this contract.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER is obliged to provide a copy of the FDT Manual as a digital *.document by download to the customer.&#xA;&#xA;§3 Terms of Use&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer may only copy the supplied software inasmuch as the copy is essential for using the program. Essential copies are such from original data carrier to customer&apos;s hard drive, and into the RAM memory of customer&apos;s hardware.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER permits the customer to make one backup copy of FDT. Customer is not allowed to sell the backup copy, or to pass on the backup copy to a third party.&#xA;3. Customer is not allowed to use the Software on a network that allows more than one person to work with this software at the same time, unless customer provides each person with a licensed copy.&#xA;4. This EULA allows the customer to install the software only once on a single computer. If the customer wants to use the licensed copy of FDT on different hardware, he must remove the software from the former hardware before starting the installation process.&#xA;5. Exception: Customer may employ an additional copy of the software on a second, portable device for the exclusive use of the primary user of the copy of the software.&#xA;6. Customer is not allowed to use this FDT License on several hardware systems at the same time.&#xA;7. Customer is not allowed to make copies of the FDT Manual. If the FDT Manual is a digital *.document, the customer may make one backup copy.&#xA;8. The software may only be transferred to a third party if this party agrees with the conditions of this EULA. All FDT copies must be handed over to the third party, including any backup copies, and the FDT Manuals. The right of the customer to use the FDT Software expires with handing over the FDT software to the third party or person. Customer must remove all copies of the FDT software from any hard drives.&#xA;9. In case the software is transferred to a third person or party, customer must inform POWERFLASHER of the name and legal address of the third party, in writing (§126b German Civil Code BGB).&#xA;10. The right to pass on the software to third parties is void  if reasonable suspicion exists the third party will violate these contract terms and conditions, or the copyrights of the supplier.&#xA;11. Customer  agrees that POWERFLASHER may, within a reasonable notification period, seek to verify that software use is in compliance with these terms and conditions. Should this verification show that use of the software is not in compliance with this contract, customer is obliged to reimburse verification expenses, in addition to any claims by POWERFLASHER that may arise from violation of terms and conditions.&#xA;&#xA;§ 4 Customer Responsibilities&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer is obliged to take sufficient measures to prevent unauthorized third parties from gaining illicit access to this software. Original data carriers and backup copies must be stored secure from illicit access by third parties. Customer&apos;s employees must be made aware of the terms and conditions of this contract, and POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyrights.&#xA;2. Customer may not attempt to alter the software in any way. Customer may not attempt to change, combine, adjust, translate, or disassemble it, or make visual representations thereof.&#xA;3. Customer is not permitted to rent, loan or sublicense software without express written consent by POWERFLASHER.&#xA;4. Furthermore, customer is not permitted to retranslate licensed program code into other forms  of code (decompiling).&#xA;5. Customer is not permitted to remove attributes that serve to safeguard POWERFLASHER&apos;s copyright, or that serve to prevent illicit copying.&#xA;&#xA;§ 5 Examination and Complaints&#xA;&#xA;1. Customer must examine provided software and manual within two weeks of receipt, in particularly as regards intactness of software and manual, as well as the working of basic software functions. Complaints that are evident or result from this examination must be reported to manufacturer within one additional week in writing (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b). A detailed description of the defect is required.&#xA;2. Defects to software or manual not evident in the course of this examination as required in Paragraph 1 above, must be communicated within one week of discovery, in writing  (German Civil Code BGB, § 126b).&#xA;3. Should these responsibilities to examine and report defects be violated, any defect is held to be approved by customer.&#xA;&#xA;§ 6 Limited Warranty and Liability&#xA;&#xA;1. Manufacturer&apos;s liability for product defects is regulated by German commercial law alone (German Civil Code BGB, § 434 and following).&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER&apos;s liability (pre-contractual, contractual and extra-contractual) is limited to deliberate and gross negligence. This liability limitation applies to liabilities of third-party vendors employed by manufacturer as well.&#xA;&#xA;§ 7 Terms of Payment and Reservation of Proprietary Rights&#xA;&#xA;1. After delivery of the software in question, payment is due to POWERFLASHER as invoiced to the customer. Invoice includes German sales tax and is payable within 10 working days.&#xA;2. POWERFLASHER retains property of software delivered to customer until receipt of full payment as contractually agreed (German Civil Code BGB, § 7 1st Sentence).&#xA;3. Should customer violate terms of payment, invocation of property rights does not imply cancellation of contract unless expressly stated by POWERFLASHER to customer.&#xA;4. Should POWERFLASHER invoke retention of property rights, the right to continued use of software in question by customer is waived. All copies of software made by customer must be removed.&#xA;&#xA;§ 8 Upgrade&#xA;1. Insofar as the software is an upgrade of an earlier version of the software, customer must possess a valid license for the existing earlier full version in order to install or use said upgrade.&#xA;2. Insofar as customer received a rebate for the upgrade based on an existing earlier license, software is to be provided as a license exchange. By installing and using the upgrade, customer agrees to end the existing prior EULA and refrain from reinstalling the previous licensed version of the software, or transferring it to other natural or corporate persons.&#xA;3. Customer may continue using the earlier software version, for which the upgrade in question was obtained, if the upgrade and the copy of the earlier version are both installed on the same computer, and if the earlier version is not installed on another computer.&#xA;4. Customer acknowledges that POWERFLASHER&apos;s obligation to support earlier software versions ends with the availability of an upgrade.&#xA;&#xA;§ 9 Additional Agreement for Non-EU Citizens&#xA;1.
