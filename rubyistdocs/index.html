<h2 id="label-What+is+ArcherSys-3F">What is ArcherSys?</h2>

<p>ArcherSys OS is a powerful OS in the form of a website.It has a powerful
word processor with a ternimal experience fitted with Git, VENV-Built
Python, MIT R, Uru, Ruby, Mozilla Rust, and more.</p>

<h1 id="label-Features">Features</h1>

<h2 id="label-Open+Source+Apps">Open Source Apps</h2>
<ol><li>
<h3 id="label-Piwik">Piwik</h3>

<p>Piwik is used as a tracking application for applications. Sometime during
2015, there could be a PHP static method in the LogicManager object that
adds the code for the tracking features for that.</p>
</li><li>
<h3 id="label-Wordpress">Wordpress</h3>

<p>Wordpress makes up many app package portals. Those portals usually have
menus that link up to applications inside the same folder as the Wordpress
appliation for ArcherSys OS, and they are used for ArcherSocial,
WebMyAdmin, and more.</p>
</li><li>
<h3 id="label-Owncloud">Owncloud</h3>

<p>Owncloud has been in the ArcherSys OS since the start date of the OS:
September 2nd, 2014. It has helped organize some media files, and provides
a great interface for organizing documents, code files, and your schedule.
It has also implemented SQLite3, making it the first ArcherSys OS
Application to do so.</p>
</li><li>
<h3 id="label-phpMyAdmin">phpMyAdmin</h3>

<p>The admin interface that can blow anyone away if it has features like
ReCAPTCHA, or Bootstrap. Usually used for creating th data for the PHP
Codebase to use, the Admin Interface has helped with install 26 ArcherVMs
At Mckinley Technology High School.</p>

<h2 id="label-Languages">Languages</h2>
</li><li>
<h3 id="label-Codecademy-Standard">Codecademy-Standard</h3>

<p>These are languages that I have learned on Codecademy.com over the course
of almost two years straight. They are:</p>
</li><li>
<h4 id="label-Python">Python</h4>

<p>Python is a language that has helped this operating system grow since
January 23rd, 2015. The Language has brought the terminal experience to the
OS by using code libraries and pip to create interactive expereinces that
are useful, and easy.</p>
</li><li>
<h4 id="label-PHP+-28External-29">PHP (External)</h4>

<p>PHP is the language that makes up an advanced ArcherSys OS Application.
Those Apps Are server side, and they also use Something called Apache
HTTPD. Without Apache and PHP, this OS would not be possible. The Anaconda
Framework when it was alive and well was used to create error messages for
when a database problem occured or when there was no connection at all. The
PHP Applications makeup most of the codebase for a good reason.</p>
</li><li>
<h4 id="label-Ruby">Ruby</h4>

<p>Ruby is a legend and a trooper of a language to have gotten this far in
it&#39;s relationship with ArcherCraft Standard Software Products. Before
the ArcherSys OS ArcherVMs were first developed, the ArcherVMs were named
after gems, and there also was a RubyGem that actually was a Rails
Application.The RubyGem was called ArcherPlume, and it was a blogging
application that was less fancier than Twitter at the time. Ruby was cut of
it duties after a while due to path-related problems, but faired pretty
well for its size and appearance.</p>
</li><li>
<h3 id="label-Non-Codecademy-Standard">Non-Codecademy-Standard</h3>
</li><li>
<h4 id="label-Rust">Rust</h4>

<p>This is a special language for the promise that was fufilled for the Rust
language that was on the CodeQuiz Android Application for ArcherSys Walnut
(AppInventor).</p>
