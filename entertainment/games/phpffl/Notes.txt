* Added a drop down menu that allows users to set their status to "Away". If set to away their picks will be Autodrafted.

- Added Ajax functionality to Live Scoring page so it doesn't need to force a browser refresh. The information will automatically refresh in the page every minute without the browser having to refresh. 

- Add Private Message functionality. Under MyTeam.

- Added the ability to have multiple games per week for a team. This is done by creating a schedule team. You then select # of games per week for each team. Default is 1. Then after you create that follow the normal process of applying that schedule to your league.

- Added ability for admins to run the autorun scripts through phpffl. Go to admin -> Autorun.
NOTE: If you edit the schedule in the demo you can check the results by running the update team stats script. This is useful for testing the multiple games per week for a team.

- Add Captcha image to Registration to avoid bots.

- Split Players on Team Page into Starting Lineup and Bench

- Created a display that shows all rosters on one page

- Printer Friendly pages. Add a printer frienly link to most pages.

- Improvements to install.php. Added code that will automatically guess your Web & Doc Root the first time you install.

- Added better error checking to the autorun scripts so they give useful error messages rather than php errors.

- Upgraded FCKEditor & ADODB 

- Added hours to Submit Trade. So teams can now say a trade is valid for X Days and Y Hours. 

- Allow users to reset their player rankings to the default ranking. And also added a link for admins to automatically do this for an entire league. 

- Added an option to display user contact information (Email & Phone Number) on the team page. To set this up for your league Edit your league and set "Display User Contact Info" to YES. Even if set to YES, a user must still be logged in to view this info. Public users who are not logged in will never be displayed email & phone number. 

- Remove Team Correspondance for all users except Admin. PM functionality replaces Team Correspondance. We left it in there so Admins could still email all teams in the league at once if they wanted. 

- Allow Admins to replace the main phpFFL header image for a league. Go to Edit League.

phpFFL 1.0 Notes: 

An updated user manual is still in the works. This is a brief description of some of the major new features associated with phpFFL 1.0. Please check the forums at phpffl.com/forums/ if you still have questions and need more detailed information. 

- Draft Modules (Basic vs Live)
NOTE: Before using either draft module make sure you set your Starting Lineup Requirements. Neither module will work correctly until you do this because they only display players that can be started in your league. So until you do this there are no players to draft! Do this in Admin->Starting Lineups.

Differences: 

Live - An ajax based draft module is included with phpFFL in addition to the 'basic' draft module that was included in last years release. This draft module is a live draft module where all teams can login to the draft module and each submit their own picks. 
VS
Basic - The basic draft module is better for in-person draft where everyone is in the same room. An admin enters all of the picks in-person or submitted via IM. Other teams can view the draft results, but only the admin can enter picks. 

To get to either draft module go to MyTeams and click on Draft

- Basic Draft Module
This is exactly the same as last year. If you were going to run your draft at a bar with a laptop & projector this module is for you.  An admin can run the draft from one screen, and if you want to network other laptops together other teams at the draft can lookup players or view the results of the draft. 

- Live Draft Module 
Teams each submit their own picks and can view picks as they happen. A league admin needs to start the draft by click "Start Draft Now" in the draft module. Only a league admin will see this so make sure your user is added to the league as an admin if you need to start the draft. Started the draft will start the timer and prompt the team with the first pick that it is their turn to pick. When it is their turn to pick a team is promted by "Draft Now!" at the top of the screen in Red. The admin can set the length of time for each round in Admin->Draft. If the time runs out for a given pick phpFFL autodrafts for that particular team. 
NOTE: a length of 0 minutues, 0 seconds for a round means that round is untimed. Teams have as long as they want to make a pick.

Autodraft is based off of the rank of players for that team. Teams can rank players by going to MyTeam->Draft. Teams can also choose a target position for a particular pick by going to this same section. A team can target a particular position or Best Available. Autodraft takes all of this into account to select the best available player for that team. 
NOTE: The first time that a team modifies the order of their rank it will take a few extra seconds to recalculate the order based on the positions used in your league. This only happens once though so updating the rank after the first time should be very quick.

A chat feature is included in the draft module. Chat conversations will appear here as well as notifications when a team makes a pick. 
In the window below the chat window teams can view rosters, Last20 picks, Next20 picks or results by round.

- Rank Players for Autodraft
Each team can create their own rank of players to be used for the autodraft feature. A default rank list is assigned to each team when they are created. Each team can then modify this by going to MyTeam->Draft and moving players up or down in the rank. 

- Target Picks by Position
To be used for the autodraft feature. Each team can set a targeted position for each pick. Teams can target a position or choose Best Available. Best available selects the highest available player on their rank regardless of position.
NOTE: If a team targets a position for a pick, but they have already maxed out on that position (roster max) then autodraft will select Best Available from any position.

- Limit # of players per position allowed per team
Created an area for admin's to set this per league. Click on Admin->Rosters to manage this.

 - Team Logo's
Admin's can set whether they want to allow users to upload a logo for their team. If allowed users can upload their team logo by going to their Profile. If they upload a logo it will be displayed on their Team homepage. 

- Display Full Name option on Scoring Pages
Make option to display full names or first initial only on Weekly Scoring overview page (Per League). By default it is firstinitial fulllastname to conserve space on that page.

- Cancel Trades
Give admins the ability to cancel pending trades always, and make it a per league option to allow teams to cancel pending trades.

- Custom Text for Playoffs on Standings Page
Allows an admin in the admin section to put the following information after the team names on the standings page. -w Clinched Wildcard; -x Clinched Playoff Spot; -y Clinched Division; -z Cannot Make Playoffs 

- Create Random Draft Order
Under Admin -> Draft you can create random order for your draft. This just ranks (randomly) the teams 1-X. From there you click Create Draft Order to build out the entire draft for your league. Remember to enter number of rounds when you create/edit your league before doing this.

- Multiple Languages
Default language is English. Also added support for German. You can set a default for your league and users can also set their own language. The only section that is not yet available for translation is the new Live Draft Module.
