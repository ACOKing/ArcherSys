## What is ArcherSys?
ArcherSys OS is a powerful OS in the form of a website.It has a powerful word processor with a ternimal experience fitted with Git, VENV-Built Python, MIT R, Uru, Ruby, Mozilla Rust, and more.

Features
==========
## Open Source Apps
1. ### Piwik
 Piwik is used as a tracking application for applications. Sometime during 2015, there could be a PHP static method in the LogicManager object that adds the code for the tracking features for that.
2. ### Wordpress
 Wordpress makes up many app package portals. Those portals usually have menus that link up to applications inside the same folder as the Wordpress appliation for ArcherSys OS, and they are used for ArcherSocial, WebMyAdmin, and more.
3. ### Owncloud
  Owncloud has been in the ArcherSys OS since the start date of the OS: September 2nd, 2014. It has helped organize some media files, and provides a great interface for organizing documents, code files, and your schedule. It has also implemented SQLite3, making it the first ArcherSys OS Application to do so.

## Languages
1. ### Codecademy-Standard
   These are languages that I have learned on Codecademy.com over the course of almost two years straight. They are:
   1. #### Python
      Python is a language that has helped this operating system grow since January 23rd, 2015. The Language has brought the terminal experience to the OS by using code libraries and pip to create interactive expereinces that are useful, and easy.
   2. #### PHP (External)
     PHP is the language that makes up an advanced ArcherSys OS Application. Those Apps Are server side, and they also use Something called Apache HTTPD. Without Apache and PHP, this OS would not be possible.
